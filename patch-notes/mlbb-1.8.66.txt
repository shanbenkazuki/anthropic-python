I. Hero Adjustments
From the Designers

In this patch, we've improved the Move and Attack control experience. It now feels smoother to Move and Attack with the same DPS.

Because it increases the late-game damage of Basic Attack heroes, we have nerfed some equipment and Battle Spells that boost Attack Speed.

Meanwhile, we've adjusted the attributes of most Marksmen to match their strength (e.g., higher early-game Attack and lower HP) to bridge their gap during early-game 1v1 fights.

We've also made adjustments to some Exp Laners to give them a chance against Fighters with War Axe.

New & Revamped Heroes

[New Hero: Chip, Phase Technician]

Hero Feature: A Support/Tank hero who can use portals to roam the battlefield and support his allies. Available on 3/16 (Server Time).

Chip is a carefree, genetically enhanced fox from Laboratory 1718. He got his name from his love of snacking on chips while lying on his hovercraft.

Chip is a Support/Tank hero. He can utilize his hovercraft to teleport around (and to slack off). His Special Skill allows him to quickly traverse the map, and his Ultimate allows him to gather all his teammates in one spot.

[Passive: Snack Time!]

Chip starts eating potato chips when out of combat, regenerating lost HP after finishing a whole bag.

[Skill 1: Crash Course]

Chip rams his hovercraft into the ground, dealing damage and applying marks on enemy heroes while gaining a shield.

Chip's next Basic Attack will become ranged, hitting all nearby enemies with marks and stunning them.

[Skill 2: Overtime]

Chip rushes forward, gaining increased Movement Speed and causing his next Basic Attack to charge at the target, dealing damage and knocking them back.

[Ultimate: Shortcut]

Chip drops the Main Portal on an enemy hero, and also creates Connecting Portals near allied heroes and behind the allied Base.

Connecting Portal: Heroes can teleport from Connecting Portals to the Main Portal and gain Burst Movement Speed, or stand on the Main Portal for a period of time to return to the Connecting Portal they came from.

Main Portal: Deals damage to nearby targets after a delay and slows them. Main Portal inherits a portion of Chip's Attributes.

[Special Skill: Why Walk?]

Chip has 4 Beacons on the map.

Chip can stand on a Beacon to enable this skill and then use it to teleport to any other Beacon.

II. Hero Adjustments
The following heroes have been adjusted in this patch: Masha (↑), Silvanna (↑), Layla (~), Miya (~), Natan (↓).

The following uses (↑) (↓) (~) to indicate Buff, Nerf, and Adjustment.

[Masha] (↑)

We want Masha to be the one leading the charge and bravely fighting in a crowd, while maintaining her role as a Tank, Fighter, or DPS Berserker. In this patch, we've removed Masha's passive that doesn't grant Defense. Now she will enhance herself each time she loses an HP bar and reset her Ultimate for her to spam skills. We also optimized her Energy Regen experience, granting her better control over her HP.

[Passive]

When Masha only has two HP bars left, skills will only require half of their original HP Cost to cast.

When Masha only has one HP bar left, she doesn't need to spend HP to cast skills.

[Skill 1]

Passive: Masha gains Power of the Wild which causes her Basic Attacks to deal extra Physical Damage equal to a percentage of the enemy's Max HP.

Active: Masha spends some HP to increase her Movement and Attack Speed, enhance the next two Basic Attacks, increase the extra damage from Power of the Wild, and gain extra Energy.

[Skill 2]

Masha spends some HP to roar at enemies, dealing Physical Damage and reducing their Attack Speed.

[Ultimate]

Masha spends some HP to lunge at an enemy hero (immune to control effects during the lunge), dealing Physical Damage, slowing them, and knocking back nearby enemies. The cooldown of this skill will be reset each time Masha loses an HP bar.

[Special Skill] (↑)

Masha gains Energy when dealing damage and can accumulate up to 100. She gains a great amount of Energy when hitting with her Skill 1. After leaving combat for 3s, Masha can spend 50 Energy to recover a full HP bar.

[Silvanna] (↑)

We've simplified Silvanna's Skill 1 to make it easier to stun enemies, while reducing her Skill 2's cooldown and increasing the Shield to keep her momentum in case her Skill 2 gets interrupted.

[Skill 1] (~)

Skill Revamp: It now has only one stage where she dashes in the target direction, dealing damage to nearby enemies and stunning them. The dash distance is reduced.

Cooldown: 12-9s >> 11-9s

[Skill 2] (↑)

Base Shield: 250-400 >> 350-500

Cooldown: 9-7s, upon skill casting >> 5.5-4.5s, after the skill ends

[Paquito] (↑)

Slightly increased his early-game damage to make him more competitive against other Fighters.

[Skill 2] (↑)

Base Damage: 150-450 >> 200-450

Champ Stance's Base Damage: 250-750 >> 350-750

[Layla] (~)

Due to her Passive, Layla can only deal a lot of damage to enemies from a distance, but her lack of mobility makes it difficult for her to get away from enemies. So we'll lower the damage bonus and increase her attack instead.

[Attributes] (↑)

Base Physical Attack: 125 >> 133

Physical Attack Growth: 7.5 >> 10

Base HP: 2500 >> 2250

HP Growth: 133.5 >> 152

[Passive] (↓)

Max Damage Increase: 130% >> 115%

[Miya] (~)

Miya is too weak in early-game 1v1 fights, so we want to increase her Skill 2 hit rate and balance her early and late game damage.

[Attributes] (~)

Base Physical Attack: 100 >> 115

Physical Attack Growth: 14 >> 10

Base HP: 2524 >> 2225

HP Growth: 138.5 >> 153

[Skill 2] (↑)

Base Damage: 90-240 >> 270-420

Reduced delay time by 25%.

[Natan] (↓)

Natan is too powerful with the new Radiant Armor, so we've lowered his late-game damage abilities while shortening his Ultimate's foreswing to make him easier and more flexible to use.

[Attributes] (↓)

Base HP: 2530 >> 2285

HP Growth: 142.4 >> 160

[Passive] (↓)

Attack Speed Boost: 7.5%-15% >> 7.5% at all levels

Basic Attack Base Damage: 45 >> 30

[Skill 1] (↓)

Base Damage: 225-525 >> 225-400

[Ultimate] (↑)

Reduced foreswing time by 50%.

[Hayabusa] (↑)

We want Hayabusa to use less Energy on his Ultimate and focus more on his shurikens.

[Ultimate] (↑)

Energy Cost: 25 >> 15

[Vexana] (↓)

Vexana is starting to show dominance in all Ranks, and we will be slightly reducing her late-game damage and Skill 1 hit rate.

[Skill 1] (↓)

Reduced projectile speed and width by 10%.

[Skill 2] (↓)

Magic Bonus: 180% >> 165%

[Guinevere] (↓)

Adding Stun to Guinevere's Skill 2 has benefited Guinevere players' control experience, but as a Fighter, she is now too powerful against enemy back-row heroes. Meanwhile, the Concentrated Energy adjustment can be considered a buff, and we want to prevent it from being overpowered again.

[Skill 2] (↓)

Cast Range: 6 >> 5

[Diggie] (↓)

Diggie's early-game damage is too powerful against the soloing enemy.

Base Damage: 500-600 >> 350-600

[Attributes] (~)

Physical Attack Growth: 7.5 >> 8.5

Base HP: 2620 >> 2320

HP Growth: 148.5 >> 170

[Argus] (↑)

As a Basic Attack Fighter with no skill to boost his Attack Speed, Argus needs more Attack now that Attack Speed equipment has been nerfed.

[Attributes] (↑)

Physical Attack Growth: 3.5 >> 6

III. Battlefield Adjustments
Limited-Time Map

The 2024 ALLSTAR Theme Map, "Euphora" will be available for a limited time!

We have designed the new event map based on the ALLSTAR music theme and revamped the background music and sound effects accordingly.

We'll also be introducing a revamped Lord in this map!

Attack Speed

In this patch, we have optimized the growth of Attack Speed by removing the Attack Speed Threshold limitation, and now every 1% of Attack Speed will result in an actual Attack Speed gain.

With this optimization, the growth of Attack Speed will be smoother instead of abruptly changing after reaching a certain Attack Speed. This also solves the problem of some heroes actually gaining 5.0 Attack Speed at 4.0 Attack Speed in the panel.

[Battle Spell]

[Inspire] (↓)

Attack Speed Boost: 1.55 times >> 1.5times

Mythic

With all the Marksmen's HP lowered, an early-game Turret dive becomes more likely. We decide to slightly increase ally hero protection from the Gold Lane Outer Turret.

[Gold Lane Outer Turret] (↑)

Damage Reduction for allied heroes when near an Energy Shield: 30% >> 35%

Equipment Adjustments

[Concentrated Energy] (↑)

We hope that Magic Fighters who rely partially on Basic Attack damage will also benefit from this equipment.

[Attributes] (↑)

20% Spell Vamp >> 20% Hybrid Lifesteal Max HP: 700 >> 400

[Oracle] (~)

We hope to make this equipment stats more universal.

[Attributes] (~)

Magic Defense: 42 >> 25

Added 25 Physical Defense

And we've also changed the build path.

[Price] (↑)

2060 >> 1860

[Radiant Armor] (~)

Changed the build path

[Corrosion Scythe] (↓)

[Attributes] (↓)

Attack Speed: 35% >> 30%

[Demon Hunter Sword] (↓)

[Attributes] (↓)

Attack Speed: 25% >> 20%

[Golden Staff] (↓)

[Unique Passive - Endless Strike] (↓)

Attack Speed of Enhanced Basic Attack: 100% >> 80%

[Sea Halberd] (↓)

[Attributes] (↓)

Attack Speed: 25% >> 20%

[Windtalker] (↓)

[Attributes] (↓)

Attack Speed: 40% >> 35%

[Haas' Claws] (↓)

[Attributes] (↓)

Attack Speed: 20% >> 15%

Battlefield Adjustments

1- Fixed an issue where the description of the distance required to move with Chou's Passive didn't match the actual effect.

4- Fixed an issue where Spell Vamp would affect the War Axe's True Damage effect.
